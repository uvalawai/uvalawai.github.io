**Expected Background:**

- Formal Prerequisite: completed CS 2100 (DSA1) or CS 2130 (CSO1).

- Informal Prerequisite: Students are not required to have machine learning background, but should be comfortable enough with programming and math concepts to be able to go through a PyTorch tutorial on their own. 

- No previous background in law is expected, but students should be willing to read legal writings.


This course meets jointly with a Law School class, and CS students will work closely with Law students throughout the semester, but will have some different assignments and will be graded separately.
